# Git Collaboration Guide

## 1. Assign a team member to create a GitHub repository

The assigned team member is also responsible for changing the initial settings for the repository. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features) for documentation on managing the features and settings of a GitHub repository.

After the team member has created the repository, they should share the GitHub URL with the other team members.

## 2. Clone the repository

Every team member should clone the repository. If an individual uses multiple computers, they should clone the repository to each separately.
